<h3>Bonjour,Hi 👋 </h3> 

<h2>Welcome to 2026. 2026 is emerging as a pivotal year for artificial intelligence, marked by the transition from AI hype to tangible implementation, the rise of agentic AI systems, and the establishment of critical standards and policies. The year is characterized by a shift toward practical, human-centered AI applications, increased regulatory oversight, and a growing focus on transparency and accountability in AI deployment across industries. </h2>

💬 I have started coding my user facing programs in Android Studio using Flutter the cross platform framework and Googles Gemini as the coder. Results are amazing and any non-mobil specific apps are generated cross platform. Gemini is fantastic at sourcing dependencies that would take hours if not days to fix. The programming ecosystem has become too complex for any one person to keep straight in their head. 

📔 Using AI to look at flat files and associated program described descriptions to build the corresponding SQL statements. This may be part of IBM AI initiative already, have to wait and see. https://ibm.github.io/rpg-genai-data/#/pages/task/modernize  

🌈 Working with Android Studio/Flutter/Dart https://flutter.dev/ to design maintenance screens using ODBC for the IBM i

📔 IBM writeup on Modernizing your physical files -> https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/system/files/inline-files/$FILE/app%20modernization%20Db2%20for%20i%20style.pdf

🌈 Using Linux Mint as a desktop O/S https://linuxmint.com/ with Android Studio https://developer.android.com/studio , Vs Code https://code.visualstudio.com/ and RDI https://www.ibm.com/products/rational-developer-for-i as development platforms. RDI is the only product that is not free. A few issues getting Android studio running in mint, download the .deb zip, extract to the /opt directory off the root, cd to the /opt/android-studio/bin directory and run the ./studio.sh script. Don't install from the software manager, it messes up because of permissions. 

📔 Did you know that IBM offers free learning resources for the Z line of processors. https://www.ibm.com/z/resources/zxplore . It covers a wide range of topics where you can upskill, reskill and learn new skills. Available at no charge, learners can gain hands-on experiences through coding challenges and working with various technologies to develop valuable skills and earn industry recognized digital badges.

<h3>Background</h3>

I have been developing business software for the over 40 years, for the IBM midrange machines (System34, System36, System38, As400, iSeries and now the IBM i), primarily in RPG (all versions) as well as in COBOL, C and Assembly, and continue to maintain the code my teams have built. 

I also help Companies navigate the sometimes confusing world of IT and connect them with the correct people or organizations required to run their business. 

Originally developed in 1959, (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG) RPG is a high level language for business with a long legacy that was introduced by IBM. After many iterations of the language and with IBM's commitment to insure backward compatibility many customers have ended up with software that spans many generations of updates and imporvements. The latest implementation of the language, while powerful,  adds a new challange in maintaining code bases that although simillar in nature require a depth of knowledge that needs grey haired programmers to maintain. RPG has been enhanced to take advantage of everything available to a developer by todays standards but also allows you to mix it with the programs written over the span of 40 years. Although preferable rewriting code is financially difficult to justify unless you can include tangable improvements so many companies choose to maintain their older code and write improvements in a newer version of the language. 

Over the next little while I will be including some of my favourite tools I have created to aid in converting older code to a more current version in the hope it will be of help to you.
