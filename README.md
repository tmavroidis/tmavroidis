Hello, I'm Tom Mavroidis ðŸ‘‹ 

This repository is for my team to get up to speed on using the IBM i.
All software is licenced under the GNU General Public License, version 3  https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html .

On the software front, I develop business software for the IBM i primarily in RPG (all versions) but also in COBOL, C and Assembly, and maintain solutions NTM Consulting https://ntm.net/ have developed over the past 37 years. I also help Companies (SMB's) navigate the sometimes confusing world of IT. 

RPG is a high level language for business with a long legacy that I was first introduced to on the System/360. After many iterations of the language and with IBM's commitment to insure backward compatibility many of our environments have become patchy at best. The latest implementation of the language enhances it so you to take advantage of everything available to a developer both on the box and on other platforms. Although preferable it is financially difficult to justify rewriting complete working systems just to make the language current unless you can include noticeable improvements. I am including some of my favourite tools to aid in converting older code to a more current model in the hope it will be of help to you.
