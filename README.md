Hello, I'm Tom Mavroidis ðŸ‘‹ 

This repository is for my team to get up to speed on using the IBM i.
All software is licenced under the GNU General Public License, version 3  https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html .

On the software front, I develop business software for the IBM i primarily in RPG (all versions) but also in COBOL, C and Assembly, and maintain solutions NTM Consulting https://ntm.net/ have developed over the past 37 years. I also help Companies (SMB's) navigate the sometimes confusing world of IT.  

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at tmavroidis@ntm.net
