<h3>Background</h3>

I have been developing business software for the over 40 years, for the IBM midrange machines (System34, System36, System38, As400, iSeries and now the IBM i), primarily in RPG (all versions) as well as in COBOL, C and Assembly, and continue to maintain the code my teams have built. 

I also help Companies navigate the sometimes confusing world of IT and connect them with the correct people or organizations required to run their business. 

Originally developed in 1959, (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG) RPG is a high level language for business with a long legacy that was introduced by IBM. After many iterations of the language and with IBM's commitment to insure backward compatibility many customers have ended up with software that spans many generations of updates and imporvements. The latest implementation of the language, while powerful,  adds a new challange in maintaining code bases that although simillar in nature require a depth of knowledge that needs grey haired programmers to maintain. RPG has been enhanced to take advantage of everything available to a developer by todays standards but also allows you to mix it with the programs written over the span of 40 years. Although preferable rewriting code is financially difficult to justify unless you can include tangable improvements so many companies choose to maintain their older code and write improvements in a newer version of the language. 

Over the next little while I will be including some of my favourite tools I have created to aid in converting older code to a more current version in the hope it will be of help to you.
